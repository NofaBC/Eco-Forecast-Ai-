Alignable Alliance In-person Events | Host Talking Points
Welcome & Purpose
 “Welcome everyone! We’re here today to help you build meaningful referral partnerships that move your business forward. The goal isn’t just to meet new people — it’s to find the connections who really understand your target customer and can open doors to new opportunities.”
Why Alignable is Different
 “Now, a lot of networking events focus on meeting as many people as possible, but that can feel overwhelming and doesn’t always deliver results. Alignable does things differently. We focus on quality over quantity. By using the information you’ve shared on your Alignable profile, the app highlights your ideal referral partners — so the time you spend networking today delivers a much higher ROI.”

 “Right now, we have [X attendees] checked in for this event, and there are [Y referral partner opportunities] in the room. That means dozens of real, high-value connections are available for you today — and the Alignable app is going to help you find them.”
For Paid Members
 “If you’re a paid Alignable member, when you checked in today the app automatically opened the attendee list for this event. Inside that list, you’ll see your personalized referral partner matches clearly highlighted. These are the people in this room who best align with your business goal based on how you describe your referral partners on your profile.

For Free Members
 “If you’re attending as a free member, welcome! You’ll still get tremendous value today by networking with other business owners and making new connections. You also have access to your personal Connect Code in the app, which makes connecting with anyone here simple and instant. If you’d like to unlock personalized match lists at this event or future events, joining Alignable membership will give you that advantage.”
Connect Code for Everyone
 “Before we get started, let’s all take a moment to open the Alignable app.. In the top right corner of the page you landed on after checking in,, you’ll see a little QR code icon — tap that, and you’ll find your personal Connect Code. You can scan each other’s codes to connect instantly, no business cards needed. And remember — connections made with Connect Codes are free, so take advantage of it.”
Closing & Call to Action
 “Before you leave today, make sure to connect with the people you’ve met here on Alignable so you can continue the conversation. Most importantly, I challenge you to schedule at least two one-on-one follow-up calls with the people you connected with today. That’s where real business relationships and referrals are born. And finally, don’t forget to fill out the event survey at the end — your feedback helps us keep improving these events.”
